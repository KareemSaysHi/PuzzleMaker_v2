GUI
- dictionary of pieces
- dictionary of positions
- dictionary of openGL objects
- dictionary of colors

- done:
    - basic pan, rotate, zoom controls with mouse

- to do:
    - interactions between assembly states and dissassembly depth
    - zoom into point
    - start zoomed out instead of being inside
    - light mode lol

PUZZLE DESIGN: ASSEMBLY
- to do 6/10:
    - algorithm for making polyominoes of certain size, returning usable ones in text file

- to do 6/11
    - finish text file implementation
    - assembly pt 1! (finish tomorrow if not done)

    ideas for 6/11

    abstract box?
    all canonical positions are at (0,0,0)

    *places it can be in
    *places it must be in

pseudocode:



for position in possible positions:
 choose largest piece, choose rotation of it
 recursively choose next piece until we're at the last pos
